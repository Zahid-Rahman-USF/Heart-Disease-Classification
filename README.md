## Description
This project explores heart disease prediction through a comprehensive machine learning workflow, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model development. The pipeline prepares and analyzes the data to predict heart disease likelihood, focusing on data-driven insights and model performance optimization.

### Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and standardizing data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizations and statistical analysis to identify key patterns and correlations.
- **Model Development**: Implementation of Decision Tree & Random Forest.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing model performance with metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.
