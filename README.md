## Description
This project explores heart disease prediction through a comprehensive machine learning workflow, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model development. The pipeline prepares and analyzes the data to predict heart disease likelihood, focusing on data-driven insights and model performance optimization.

### Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and standardizing data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizations and statistical analysis to identify key patterns and correlations.
- **Model Development**: Implementation of Decision Tree & Random Forest.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing model performance with metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Zahid-Rahman-USF/HeartDiseasePredictionProject.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the Code Directory**:
    ```bash
    cd HeartDiseasePredictionProject/code
    ```
3. **Set Up Environment**:
    - Install necessary Python packages using:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. **Run Preprocessing**:
    - Execute the `preprocessing.py` script to clean and prepare the data.
2. **Run EDA**:
    - Use `eda.py` to generate visualizations and analyze the dataset's characteristics.
3. **Model Training and Evaluation**:
    - Train models and evaluate performance by running the `model_training.py` script.
4. **Visualization**:
    - Generate visual insights from the predictions with `visualization.py`.
